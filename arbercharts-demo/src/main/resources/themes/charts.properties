# Theme properties for ArberCharts Demo
#
# NOTE (Demo policy):
# - FlatLaf theme files (FlatDarkLaf.properties / FlatLightLaf.properties) are the primary source of truth.
#   Colors defined there are available via UIManager (e.g. Chart.background, Chart.grid.color, Chart.accent.*).
# - This file provides OPTIONAL overrides for chart palette tuning and demo defaults.
#   If a key is not present here, the active FlatLaf theme wins.

# IMPORTANT:
# Do not define base UI colors (background/foreground/axisLabel/grid) here.
# Those must come from the active FlatLaf theme to ensure perfect dark/light consistency.

# Optional series palette overrides (kept for demo tuning)
series1 = #0090FF
series2 = #FF6F00
series3 = #43A047
series4 = #D81B60
series5 = #8E24AA

# Light mode optional series palette overrides
light.series1 = #0090FF
light.series2 = #FF6F00
light.series3 = #43A047
light.series4 = #D81B60
light.series5 = #8E24AA

# Demo behavior defaults
# Standard animation duration in milliseconds
animation.duration = 300
# Antialiasing quality (low, medium, high)
render.antialiasing = high
