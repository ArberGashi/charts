# ArberCharts Licensing Model

This document describes the proposed commercial licensing model for ArberCharts.
It is intended to make development frictionless while ensuring paid distribution
for end-customer products.

Note: This is a product policy document, not legal advice.

---

## 1) Summary

ArberCharts is proprietary software.

We use a dual-track commercial model:
- **Developer License**: free, unlimited, for development and evaluation.
- **Distribution/Runtime License**: paid, required for products shipped to end customers.

This keeps adoption easy for developers while ensuring commercial value from
production usage.

ArberCharts ships with **158 renderer families** across standard, financial, statistical,
specialized, medical, and analysis domains.

## 2) Developer License (Free, Unlimited)

Permitted:
- Development, prototyping, and internal testing
- CI/CD usage
- Proof-of-concept demos
- Internal tooling (non-distributed)

Not permitted:
- Shipping a product to end customers
- Redistribution of ArberCharts binaries as part of a commercial product

No expiration and no seat limit by default (can be adjusted in enterprise deals).

## 3) Distribution/Runtime License (Paid)

Required when a product using ArberCharts is:
- Sold to end customers, or

Optional alternatives (by agreement):
